From a machine with an X server:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh -X pi@<IP of Pi>
#+END_SRC sh

Then on the Pi:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd opencv
make run-container
#+END_SRC sh

Then in the container:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python test-image.py
#+END_SRC sh

* Pi setup

wpa_supplicant.conf with passwords for my home network and phone hotspot.

Camera enabled (raspi-config -> /boot/config.txt).

sudo aptitude install emacs git docker.io imagemagick virtualenv python-dev

(.emacs and org repo copied from work laptop)

(Emacs packages installed: paredit, auto-complete, go-autocomplete, go-guru, magit.)

opencv subdir under $HOME, with venv in opencv/venv.  In that venv:
- pip install picamera[array]

opencv/Makefile has run-container target that runs shell in a
container that maps the opencv subdir and adds in an OpenCV install.
